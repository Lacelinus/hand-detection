# Hand Detection using OpenCV and MediaPipe

This project demonstrates hand detection using OpenCV and MediaPipe. It captures video from your computer's default camera, detects hands in real-time, and overlays landmarks and connections on the detected hands.

## Overview

This project showcases real-time hand detection and tracking using computer vision techniques. It can be a valuable foundation for various applications involving hand interaction.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this project to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Install the necessary libraries by running `pip install opencv-python mediapipe`.
4. Run the `hand_detection.py` script.
5. The application will access your computer's default camera and display real-time hand detection.


## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before running the code:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/): The programming language used for this project.
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/):  Open-source computer vision library
- [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/): A framework for building multimodal (eg. hands, face, pose) pipelines.

## Important Notes

This project provides a solid starting point for hand detection and tracking applications or for those interested in computer vision. Feel free to modify and extend the code to suit your specific needs.
