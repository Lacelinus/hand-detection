# Hand Detection using OpenCV and MediaPipe

This project demonstrates hand detection using OpenCV and MediaPipe. It captures video from your computer's default camera, detects hands in real-time, and overlays landmarks and connections on the detected hands.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this project.
2. Ensure that Python is installed and the required libraries are installed (OpenCV and MediaPipe).
3. Run the project.
4. Bring your hand in front of your camera. When detected, you should see your hands with landmarks and connections overlaid.
5. Press the "q" key on your keyboard to exit the application.

## Used Libraries

- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/): Used for computer vision tasks.
- [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/): Used for hand detection and tracking.

## Project Files

- `hand_detection.py`: The main Python file containing the hand detection code.
- `README.md`: This file containing project descriptions.

## Important Notes

- Make sure you have installed the required OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries for the code to work properly.

This project serves as an excellent starting point for hand detection and tracking applications or for those interested in computer vision. Enjoy exploring!
